Project Overview – Human Resource Data Analysis Using 
Power BI 

This project focuses on analyzing employee performance data to uncover insights that 
enhance decision-making in Human Resources. The goal is to understand the key factors affecting 
employee satisfaction, performance, and attrition while also identifying improvement opportunities. 

Objectives: 

• Identify the factors that contribute to employee attrition. 
• Measure employee satisfaction across various dimensions, such as job, environment, and 
manager relationships. 
• Analyze the impact of training opportunities on performance. 
• Understand how demographic and job-related factors (age, department, marital status, etc) 
Influence employee retention and satisfaction. 
• Provide data-driven insights through interactive dashboards for HR decision-making. 
Data Sources: 
• Employee Table: Contains demographic and job-related information such as age, gender, 
department, job role, salary, years at company, overtime status, marital status, and more. 
• Performance Table: Includes periodic performance reviews covering metrics like self and 
manager ratings, job satisfaction, work-life balance, training participation, and relationship 
satisfaction.  
• Education Level Table: Provides clear labels for numeric education levels (e.g., 1 to 5). 
• Rating Level Table: Converts numerical ratings (e.g., 1 to 5) into descriptive text (e.g., " 
Unacceptable", " Meets Expectation", " Above and Beyond") for both self and manager 
ratings. 
• Satisfaction Level Table: Converts numerical Satisfied (e.g., 1 to 5) into descriptive text 
(e.g., "Very Dissatisfied", "Neutral", "Very Satisfied"). This table maps satisfaction scores 
into categories for easier analysis and comparison across environments, jobs, and 
relationships. 
Tools Used: 
• Power BI was used for data cleaning, modeling, and creating interactive visualizations.

• Total number of active employees. 
• Employee attrition rate.
